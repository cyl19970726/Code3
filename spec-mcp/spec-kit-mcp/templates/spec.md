# Feature Specification: User Authentication

**Feature Branch**: `feat/001-user-auth`
**Created**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: "Add user authentication with email/password, verification, and password reset"

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a new user, I want to create an account with email and password so that I can access personalized features and securely save my data.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** user visits signup page, **When** user enters valid email and password (8+ chars, 1 uppercase, 1 number), **Then** account is created, verification email is sent, and user sees "Check your email" message
2. **Given** user clicks verification link in email, **When** token is valid and not expired, **Then** account is activated and user is redirected to login page
3. **Given** user enters existing email during signup, **When** user submits form, **Then** error message "Email already exists" is shown
4. **Given** user enters weak password (< 8 chars), **When** user submits form, **Then** error message "Password must be at least 8 characters with 1 uppercase and 1 number" is shown
5. **Given** verified user enters correct credentials, **When** user submits login form, **Then** user is logged in and redirected to dashboard
6. **Given** user enters incorrect password 5 times, **When** user attempts 6th login, **Then** account is locked and user sees "Account locked. Check email for unlock instructions"
7. **Given** user forgot password, **When** user submits password reset request, **Then** reset email is sent with time-limited token
8. **Given** user clicks reset link in email, **When** token is valid, **Then** user can enter new password and successfully login

### Edge Cases
- What happens if user loses internet connection during signup?
- How to handle duplicate email registrations from concurrent requests?
- What if email service is down during verification email sending?
- How long should verification tokens remain valid?
- Should password reset tokens be single-use or multi-use?
- What happens if user requests multiple password resets?
- How to handle brute force login attempts?
- Should users be notified of suspicious login activity?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-1**: System shall allow users to register with email and password
- **FR-2**: System shall validate email format against RFC 5322 standard
- **FR-3**: System shall enforce password requirements: minimum 8 characters, at least 1 uppercase letter, at least 1 number
- **FR-4**: System shall hash passwords using bcrypt with cost factor 12 before storage
- **FR-5**: System shall never store passwords in plain text
- **FR-6**: System shall send verification email with time-limited token after registration
- **FR-7**: System shall prevent duplicate email registrations (case-insensitive comparison)
- **FR-8**: System shall allow users to login with verified email and password
- **FR-9**: System shall lock account after 5 consecutive failed login attempts
- **FR-10**: System shall send account unlock email with instructions after account lock
- **FR-11**: System shall provide password reset functionality via email
- **FR-12**: System shall expire password reset tokens after 1 hour
- **FR-13**: System shall expire verification tokens after 24 hours
- **FR-14**: System shall log all login attempts (success and failure) with timestamp and IP address
- **FR-15**: System shall allow users to logout from current session

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-1**: Password hashing operation shall complete within 200ms for p95
- **NFR-2**: Login operation shall complete within 500ms for p95 (excluding network latency)
- **NFR-3**: System shall support at least 1000 concurrent user registrations
- **NFR-4**: Email delivery shall not block user registration flow (async processing)
- **NFR-5**: System shall maintain user session for 7 days (with "remember me") or 24 hours (without)

### Key Entities *(data model)*
- **User**: id, email, passwordHash, emailVerified (boolean), accountLocked (boolean), createdAt, lastLogin, lockReason
- **VerificationToken**: token (UUID), userId, expiresAt, type (email_verify | password_reset | account_unlock), used (boolean)
- **LoginAttempt**: id, userId, ipAddress, userAgent, success (boolean), failureReason, timestamp
- **Session**: sessionId, userId, createdAt, expiresAt, ipAddress, userAgent

## Clarifications
*This section will be populated by /clarify command*

### Session 2025-10-01
- Q: How long should verification tokens remain valid? → A: 24 hours
- Q: Should password reset tokens be single-use or multi-use? → A: Single-use for security
- Q: Should users be notified of suspicious login activity? → A: Yes, send email notification for login from new device/location

## Instructions for LLM (This section should NOT appear in generated files)

**How to use this template**:

1. **Read this entire file** to understand the structure and format
2. **Create a NEW spec.md** based on user's feature description
3. **Follow the same structure**:
   - Same section headings (## User Scenarios & Testing, ## Requirements, etc.)
   - Same format for requirements (FR-1, FR-2, NFR-1, NFR-2)
   - Same format for scenarios (GIVEN-WHEN-THEN with numbers)
   - Same format for entities (Name: attributes)
4. **Replace ALL example content**:
   - "User Authentication" → actual feature name
   - All requirements → actual requirements from feature description
   - All scenarios → actual scenarios
   - All entities → actual entities
5. **Quality targets**:
   - 12-20 functional requirements
   - 3-8 acceptance scenarios
   - 3-5 edge cases
   - 4-6 key entities
   - 8,000-12,000 characters total
6. **Important**:
   - DO NOT copy "User Authentication" content
   - DO NOT keep example requirements
   - DO use the same format and structure
   - DO aim for similar level of detail

**Common mistakes to avoid**:
- ❌ Keeping {{FEATURE_NAME}} or other placeholders
- ❌ Copying example content (User Authentication)
- ❌ Adding implementation details (tech stack, APIs)
- ❌ Writing too few requirements (< 10)
- ❌ Missing GIVEN-WHEN-THEN format in scenarios
