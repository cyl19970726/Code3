# Feature Specification: Build A User Authentication System Where Users Can

**Feature Branch**: `007-build-a-user-authentication-system-where-users-can`
**Created**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: Draft

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to login so that I can achieve my goal.

### Acceptance Scenarios
0. **Given** user is on the login page, **When** user enters valid credentials and clicks &quot;login&quot;, **Then** user is successfully authenticated and redirected to the dashboard

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user provides invalid input?
- How does the system handle network failures or timeouts?
- What happens when the user tries to perform the action without proper permissions?
- What happens after multiple failed login attempts?
- How does the system handle concurrent logins from different devices?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-0**: System MUST allow user to login
- **FR-1**: System MUST handle password securely
- **FR-2**: System MUST vague adjective [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Define &quot;fast&quot; - what are the measurable criteria? (e.g., &lt;100ms response time, 99.9% uptime)]
- **FR-3**: System MUST vague adjective [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Define &quot;secure&quot; - what are the measurable criteria? (e.g., &lt;100ms response time, 99.9% uptime)]

### Key Entities *(data model)*
- **Password**: Encrypted password for user authentication
