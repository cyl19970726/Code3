# Feature Specification: Build A Scalable Admin Dashboard Where Admins Can 

**Feature Branch**: `006-build-a-scalable-admin-dashboard-where-admins-can-`
**Created**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: Draft

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to authenticate so that I can achieve my goal.

### Acceptance Scenarios
0. **Given** user is on the login page, **When** user enters valid credentials and clicks &quot;authenticate&quot;, **Then** user is successfully authenticated and redirected to the dashboard
1. **Given** user has a file to upload, **When** user selects the file and clicks &quot;upload&quot;, **Then** the file is uploaded successfully and user sees a confirmation message
2. **Given** user wants to create a new item, **When** user fills in the form and clicks &quot;create&quot;, **Then** the item is created and added to the list
3. **Given** user needs to edit, **When** user performs the edit action, **Then** the system successfully completes the edit and provides feedback

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user provides invalid input?
- How does the system handle network failures or timeouts?
- What happens when the user tries to perform the action without proper permissions?
- What happens after multiple failed login attempts?
- How does the system handle concurrent logins from different devices?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-0**: System MUST allow user to authenticate
- **FR-1**: System MUST allow user to upload
- **FR-2**: System MUST allow user to create
- **FR-3**: System MUST allow user to edit
- **FR-4**: System MUST handle email securely
- **FR-5**: System MUST handle password securely
- **FR-6**: System MUST handle profile securely
- **FR-7**: System MUST handle file securely
- **FR-8**: System MUST vague adjective [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Define &quot;fast&quot; - what are the measurable criteria? (e.g., &lt;100ms response time, 99.9% uptime)]
- **FR-9**: System MUST vague adjective [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Define &quot;scalable&quot; - what are the measurable criteria? (e.g., &lt;100ms response time, 99.9% uptime)]
- **FR-10**: System MUST vague adjective [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Define &quot;secure&quot; - what are the measurable criteria? (e.g., &lt;100ms response time, 99.9% uptime)]

### Key Entities *(data model)*
- **Email**: Email address used for communication and authentication
- **Password**: Encrypted password for user authentication
- **Profile**: Represents a profile in the system
- **File**: User-uploaded file with metadata (name, size, type, upload date)
