# Feature Specification: Build A File Upload System Where Users Can Upload 

**Feature Branch**: `004-build-a-file-upload-system-where-users-can-upload-`
**Created**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: Draft

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to upload so that I can achieve my goal.

### Acceptance Scenarios
0. **Given** user has a file to upload, **When** user selects the file and clicks &quot;upload&quot;, **Then** the file is uploaded successfully and user sees a confirmation message
1. **Given** user needs to receive, **When** user performs the receive action, **Then** the system successfully completes the receive and provides feedback

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user provides invalid input?
- How does the system handle network failures or timeouts?
- What happens when the user tries to perform the action without proper permissions?
- What happens when the uploaded file exceeds the size limit?
- What happens when the file format is not supported?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-0**: System MUST allow user to upload
- **FR-1**: System MUST allow user to receive
- **FR-2**: System MUST handle file securely

### Key Entities *(data model)*
