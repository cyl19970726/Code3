**Feature Branch**: `005-admin-dashboard-where-admins-can-create-users-edit`
**Created**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: Draft

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to create so that I can achieve my goal.

### Acceptance Scenarios
0. **Given** user wants to create a new item, **When** user fills in the form and clicks &quot;create&quot;, **Then** the item is created and added to the list
1. **Given** user needs to edit, **When** user performs the edit action, **Then** the system successfully completes the edit and provides feedback
2. **Given** user has an existing item, **When** user clicks &quot;delete&quot; on the item, **Then** the item is removed and user sees a confirmation message
3. **Given** user needs to view, **When** user performs the view action, **Then** the system successfully completes the view and provides feedback

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user provides invalid input?
- How does the system handle network failures or timeouts?
- What happens when the user tries to perform the action without proper permissions?
