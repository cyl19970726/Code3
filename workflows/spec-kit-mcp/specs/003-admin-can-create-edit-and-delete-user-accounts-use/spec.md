**Created**: 2025-10-02
**Status**: Draft

- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to upload so that I can achieve my goal.

### Acceptance Scenarios
0. **Given** user has a file to upload, **When** user selects the file and clicks &quot;upload&quot;, **Then** the file is uploaded successfully and user sees a confirmation message
1. **Given** user needs to send, **When** user performs the send action, **Then** the system successfully completes the send and provides feedback
2. **Given** user wants to create a new item, **When** user fills in the form and clicks &quot;create&quot;, **Then** the item is created and added to the list
3. **Given** user needs to edit, **When** user performs the edit action, **Then** the system successfully completes the edit and provides feedback
4. **Given** user has an existing item, **When** user clicks &quot;delete&quot; on the item, **Then** the item is removed and user sees a confirmation message

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user provides invalid input?
- How does the system handle network failures or timeouts?
- What happens when the user tries to perform the action without proper permissions?
- What happens when the uploaded file exceeds the size limit?
- What happens when the file format is not supported?
