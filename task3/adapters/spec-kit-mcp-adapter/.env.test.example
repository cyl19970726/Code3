# ============================================
# E2E Test Configuration
# ============================================
# Copy this file to .env.test and fill in your test credentials
#
# System configurations (RPC URLs, Contract Addresses) are managed
# in src/chain-config.ts - tests will automatically use them.

# ----------------
# GitHub (Required)
# ----------------
# Personal Access Token with 'repo' scope
# Get from: https://github.com/settings/tokens
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_your_github_token_here

# Test Repository (format: "owner/repo")
# Create a dedicated test repository to avoid polluting your main repo
TEST_REPO=your-github-username/code3-e2e-test

# ----------------
# Blockchain Keys (Choose one or both based on which chain you're testing)
# ----------------
# Ethereum Private Key (for Sepolia testnet)
# Get testnet ETH from: https://sepoliafaucet.com/
# You need at least 0.1 ETH for multiple test runs
ETHEREUM_PRIVATE_KEY=0x_your_ethereum_private_key_here

# Aptos Private Key (for Aptos testnet)
# Get testnet APT from: https://aptoslabs.com/testnet-faucet
# You need at least 1 APT for multiple test runs
APTOS_PRIVATE_KEY=0x_your_aptos_private_key_here

# ============================================
# Notes:
# ============================================
# - System configs are in src/chain-config.ts:
#   * Ethereum Sepolia RPC URL
#   * Ethereum Contract Address (auto-managed)
#   * Aptos Testnet RPC URL
#   * Aptos Module Address (auto-managed)
#
# - All E2E tests create real resources:
#   * GitHub Issues
#   * GitHub Pull Requests
#   * Blockchain transactions
#
# - Manual cleanup required after tests:
#   * Close test Issues
#   * Close test PRs
#   * Delete test branches
#
# - Ensure sufficient testnet tokens before running tests
